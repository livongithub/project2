    <div id="text">My stamp collection is one of the main memories I have of my grandfather. I shared this interest with him, we exchanged collectibles, and he would send me letters with special stamps so that I could remove them carefully and include them in my book. I started assembling in 2008, and was gifted my first collection book in 2010. My grandfather was Norwegian, which is why my collection is titled in the language. Looking back on his memory and the absurdity of having a stamp collection at age 5, this website hilights the important stamps of my collection.</div>
